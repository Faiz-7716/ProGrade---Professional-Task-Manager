## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Vibrant blue (#4285F4) to convey trust and professionalism. The hue suggests competence and confidence, but stops short of a cliche choice.
- Background color: Light gray (#F5F5FA), a desaturated tint of blue to create a clean, professional look and contrast well with the content.
- Accent color: Yellow (#FFC107), an analogous color to the primary, chosen to highlight key CTAs and interactive elements, thus bringing an element of energy and warmth.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif font known for its clean, modern appearance and excellent readability, ensuring a professional and accessible design.
- Use simple, professional icons from a consistent set (e.g., Material Design Icons) to represent different profile sections and actions.
- Maintain a clean, card-based layout to clearly separate the different parts of the interface, ensuring a consistent and easy-to-follow design. Focus on readability with ample white space.
- Use subtle transitions and animations for feedback on user interactions (e.g., button presses, content loading). These should be fast, smooth and professional.
